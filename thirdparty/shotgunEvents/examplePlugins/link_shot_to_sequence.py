Required fields
    Shot entity:
         - Shot Code {code}
         - Sequence {sg_sequence}
    Sequence entity:
        - Sequence Code {code}

Logic
    When a Shot is created either by Human User or by Script User, and the Sequence field is
    blank, update the Sequence based on the following criteria:

    1. The Shot Code matches the proper Shot naming convention defined by the "shot_code_regex"
       plugin setting.

    2. There's a Sequence where the "Sequence Code" field (defined by the "sequence_code_field"
       plugin setting) matches the first grouping match of the "shot_code_regex"

    3. The Sequence matches any additional filters defined in the "sequence_filters" plugin
       setting.

    If a valid matching Sequence is found, update the Shot's Sequence field accordingly.


Plugin Args
    - shot_code_regex: (required) String containing the regex used to match a valid Shot code
                       as well as capture a valid Sequence code. The captured Sequence code
                       must be in the first group.
    - sequence_code_regex_group: In the case there are multiple groups identified in the
                                 shot_code_regex, the group number that identifies the Sequence
                                 code to lookup.
                                 (default = 1)
    - sequence_code_field: String designating the field name to search for the
                           sequence code captured by the shot_code_regex.
                           (default = sg_sequence_code)
    - sequence_filters: List of additional filters to use when finding a matching Sequence.
                        The default will always filter for Sequences in the current Project
                        and Sequences where the "sequence_code_field" matches the grouping
                        match from the shot_code_regex.
                        (default = [])

    Example:
        This will match a Shot named JL4001 and capture "JL" as the Sequence code and will query
        SG for a Sequence in the current Project where sg_sequence_code = "JL" and
        sg_status_list != "na":

        {
            "shot_code_regex": "^([A-Za-z]{2})([0-9]{4})\",
            "sequence_code_field": "sg_sequence_code",
            "sequence_filters": [["sg_status_list", "is_not", "na"]]
