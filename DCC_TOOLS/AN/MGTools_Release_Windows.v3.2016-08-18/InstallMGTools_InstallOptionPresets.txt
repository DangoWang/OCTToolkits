# You set up this file to affect the installation presets of MGTools Pro.

# The Line starts with ">" is just a title that helps you understand the what the option is for; 
# The line starts with # is just a comment that will be ignored; 
# The line starts with neither of both, but "(digit)" or "[digit]", is the preset value you choose;
# If all the options values are commented out, installation tool will use its factory default value;
# If all the values are not commented out, will use the down most value.

# So, if you wanna set the MGTools installation presets for your pipeline, 
# please comment/uncomment the preset values,
# the preset value start with "(digit)" is a single choice preset, starts with "[digit]" is multiple choices preset,
# also please Leave the title line alone.

# after that, when you install MGTools among different computers, 
# you can just ignore all the install options and click "Next" to finish the installation.
