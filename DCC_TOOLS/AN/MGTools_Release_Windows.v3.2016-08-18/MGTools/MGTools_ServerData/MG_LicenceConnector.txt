# Both absolute and relative path are supported.

# Example of relative path:
# 	ConnectorDirectory = ./connector
#	ConnectorDirectory = ../../../myconnector

# tips: both "/" or "\" are ok, whether or not the path ends with / does not matter.
#       Please input raw path at the right side of "=", do not wrap path with "".
