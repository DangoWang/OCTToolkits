# You don't need to care about this if you are the only one who use the same MG-Picker Studio program,or you used a local install mode.
# This is for changing the directory that will contains all the user-configs.
#
# By default, user configs are stored in the "MGPicker_UserConfig" folder beside the program folder "MGPicker_Program".
# This is ok if the program only be used by one local user, however, once it is used by multiple user,
# then the "MGPicker_UserConfig" will become publicly shared and effect every local users.
#
# if you need to share say CommandButtonPresets, CodeSnippets or Converterss to everybody in the pipeline, 
# it is suggested that you put those into respective folders in "MGPicker_Program" folder instead.
#
# For every local user being able to has their own config of those, you need to setup as follow:
#
# Please directly input a path at the right side of MGPICKER_USER_CONFIG_DIR = , don't wrap with "":
# Relative path is not supported.
#
# Example values are:
#
# 1. Empty value, means using the default setting:
#
#       MGPICKER_USER_CONFIG_DIR =      # This means the config will stored in "MGPicker_UserConfig" folder beside "MGPicker_Program" folder.
#
# 2. Any absolute path:
#    
# 	MGPICKER_USER_CONFIG_DIR = D:/anyFolder/myMGPicker_UserConfigs       # Configs within will effect all maya versions in the local machine
# 
# 3. Within local maya user app folder, in windows like "My Documents/maya/MG_PickerUserConfig": 
#    
#	MGPICKER_USER_CONFIG_DIR = $UserAppDir            # Configs within will effect all maya versions in the local machine
# 
# 4. Within local maya user script folder, in windows like "My Documents/maya/2016/scripts/MG-PickerStudio/MGPicker_UserConfig":
#    
#	MGPICKER_USER_CONFIG_DIR = $UserScriptDir         # Configs within will only effect one specific maya version in the local machine
#
#
# Another way to setup this, is to author an env with name "MGPICKER_USER_CONFIG_DIR", same value rules apply.
# If the env MGPICKER_USER_CONFIG_DIR is setup already, the setting here will be ignored.

# Ok, you know what to do now, please:

MGPICKER_USER_CONFIG_DIR =
