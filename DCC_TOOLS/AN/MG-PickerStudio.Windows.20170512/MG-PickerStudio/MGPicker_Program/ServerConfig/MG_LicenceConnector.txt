# Input the directory that contains MG-LicenceConnector at the left of = sign.
# If user did not manually pick MG-LicenceConnector from other path,
# then the path here will be used by it.
# Both absolute and relative path are supported.

# Example of relative path:
# 	MGPICKER_FLOAT_LIC_CONNECTOR_DIR = ./connector
#	MGPICKER_FLOAT_LIC_CONNECTOR_DIR = ../../../myconnector

# tips: both "/" or "\" are ok, whether or not the path ends with / does not matter.
#       Please input raw path at the right side of "=", do not wrap path with "".

# Another way to setup this, is to author an env with name "MGPICKER_FLOAT_LIC_CONNECTOR_DIR", same value rules apply.
# If the env MGPICKER_FLOAT_LIC_CONNECTOR_DIR is setup already, the setting here will be ignored.
