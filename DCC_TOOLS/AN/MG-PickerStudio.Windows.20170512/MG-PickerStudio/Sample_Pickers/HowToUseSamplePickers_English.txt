> How to open and use these pickers:
	1: Install the MG-Picker Studio program. 
     	   Use F8 key to toggle between animator mode and designer mode.
	   If you just wanna test to see how picker works for animator, use the animator mode, 
	   if you just want a designing example, use designer mode.

	2: Double click on the empty area, browse and pick the .mgpkr file in each picker folder.
	   This loads the picker file into MG-Picker Studio, 
	   an alternative way is drag and drop the .mgpkr file onto the program.

	3: You still need to reference the corresponding rig in order to use them.
	   Download the rig and reference them into the maya scene, 
	   remember to use namespaces while referencing them.

	4: Select any part of the rig, make sure the MG-Picker Studio is currently actived, 
	   press "ctrl+shift+alt+S" keys to bring up the namespace setting dialog, 
           The dialog can also be triggered by selecting the "Set Namespace.." menu from the top-right "..." button.
	   Press the "<" button to fetch the namespace that being used by your rig.
	   This sets the namespace of the picker to match the namespace of your scene rig.

	5: Enjoy!
